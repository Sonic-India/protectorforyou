As a registered user of our Services, we retain your personal data for as long as you maintain an active account. However, if you haven't utilized our Services for a consecutive 18-month period, we will proceed to deactivate your account and delete your personal information.

## Third Party Services

Our Services may be integrated with third-party services to provide a seamless experience for you. In this context, it may be necessary for us to receive information from these third-party services about you, or we may share your information with them to ensure smooth interoperability.

For instance, when you provide us with your GPS location, it enables us to share it with your designated protectors or use it for mapping purposes within our Services. Additionally, you may choose to use third-party services to create your user profile or log in to our platform, which may involve sharing information with these third-party services and connecting your user profile with them.

These third-party services may automatically grant us access to certain personal information they retain about you, such as your mobile phone number, name, photo, gender, and year of birth. By using our Services, you agree to allow us to collect, use, and retain this information provided by these third-party services in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

It's important to note that we never store any passwords created for third-party services. Your interaction with these third-party services is governed by their respective terms and privacy policies. You have control over the information you allow us to access through the settings on the relevant third-party service. We respect your choices and privacy preferences in relation to these integrations.

## Transfer of Your Personal Data

To provide our Services effectively, it may be necessary to transfer, process, and store your personal information in various countries, including India, among others. Additionally, we may utilize cloud-based services for these purposes.

In some instances, we may engage third-party service providers located in countries other than your home country to handle the storage or processing of your information. Consequently, information collected in one country may be transferred to and processed in another country, which may not have the same level of data protection regulations as the country where the information was originally collected. By using our Services, you acknowledge and consent to such transfers and processing of your information, consistent with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.

We are committed to taking all reasonable precautions to safeguard your personal information from misuse, loss, and unauthorized access. To this end, we have implemented physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards. Your data will be stored on secure servers and protected by restricted access networks, ensuring that only a few authorized personnel have access to it.

Our dedication to protecting your data extends to ensuring that the necessary security measures are in place to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your personal information.

As a volunteer, your name, photo, age, contact information, location, and gender will be shared with the user in distress only if you willingly agree to offer your help. This way, we facilitate a supportive and caring environment for all users of our platform.

## Security of Your Personal Data

Indeed, we highly value the security of your personal data and take diligent measures to protect it. However, it is essential to recognize that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage can be completely infallible. Despite our earnest efforts to implement commercially acceptable security practices, we cannot provide an absolute guarantee of 100% security for your personal data.

As technology evolves, so do potential threats, making it an ongoing challenge to maintain an entirely impregnable system. Nevertheless, we are committed to using industry-standard security measures and continually enhancing our security protocols to safeguard your information to the best of our ability.

We encourage you to exercise caution and follow recommended security practices when using our Services and the internet in general.
